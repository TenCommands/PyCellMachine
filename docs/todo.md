Everything Between Here Is Required For Gameplay To Exist

- Cell Class
   - Holds initial information that defines the functionality of a Cell
- Tile Class
   - Holds current Cell information such as position, rotation, etc.
- Grid Class
   - Holds all of the Tiles
- Menu Class
   - Allows for modders to create Menus which can contain all Menu objects and Grids which users can interact with.
   - Able to get information about the Menu to enact actions on the Cell such as positions of Cells within a Grid in that Menu being used to determine the overall functionality of the Cell.
- Examples
   - A folder within the Cell defining folder allowing for the mod creator to create examples of how the Cell works.
